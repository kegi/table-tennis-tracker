## How to use it ?

Left player is associated with the left click of the mouse and the right player with the right button.

You can buy a very cheap bluetooth mouse and solder 2 buttons to the mouse motherboard to extend the original buttons. You simply fix both buttons to the tables and you have a wireless bluetooth table !
